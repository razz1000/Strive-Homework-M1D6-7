/* EXERCISE 1
    Write a function called dice; it should randomize an integer number between 1 and 6.
*/

let dice = () => {

/* EXERCISE 2
    Write a function called splitMe which receives a string as a parameter and returns an array with every word in that string.
    Ex.: splitMe("I love coding") => returns ["I", "Love", "Coding"]
*/

let splitMe = (str) => {
  return str.split(' ');
}

splitMe("Hi there my name is Rasmus") // prints out : Â ['Hi', 'there', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'Rasmus']



/* EXERCISE 3
    Write a function called deleteOne which receives a string and a boolean as parameters.
    If the boolean value is true it should return the string without the first letter, otherwise it should remove the last one from it.
*/

let deleteOne = (str, something) => {
  if (str === something) {
    return str.substring(1);
  } else { 
    return str.substring(0, str.length - 1);

  }
}
deleteOne("awesomeness");



/* EXERCISE 4
    Write a function called rollTheDices which receives a number as a parameter.
    It should invoke the dice() function defined in Ex1 the specified amount of times,
    and return an object containing a sum property holding the sum of all values extracted
    and a values array containing the single values of the dicerolls themselves.
    Example: RollTheDices(3) => returns {
        sum: 10
        values: [3, 3, 4]
    }
